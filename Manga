In order to get used to women and grow as a man, he mustered up the courage to make a reservation with a rental girlfriend! But what came was a bit (?) weird girl, Tsukita-san! Tsukita-san is going above and beyond what he expected, and Hoshino-kun is getting overwhelmed. A new addictive romantic comedy about the exquisite relationship between the two!!!",
